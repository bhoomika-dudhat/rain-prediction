          <h2>Empowering Farmers with Smart Crop Choices</h2>
          <p>Agriculture is a vital sector globally, and the efficiency of crop 
            production significantly impacts food security and economic stability. However, selecting the appropriate crop for cultivation is a complex decision influenced by various factors such as soil nutrients, climate conditions, and rainfall patterns. This project aims to develop a Crop Recommendation System leveraging machine learning models to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection.

      <h2>About Crop Recommendation</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">The primary objective of this project is to 
        build a robust system that recommends suitable 
        crops based on six key factors: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, 
        humidity, pH level, and rainfall. By analyzing these factors, the system 
        predicts the most compatible crops for a given geographical location and environmental conditions.
        The project utilizes a dataset containing information about different crops and their ideal growing conditions. Various machine learning algorithms are 
        employed to create predictive models capable of classifying crops based on input parameters. 
        The models explored include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest 
        Neighbors, Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost classifiers. 
        These models are trained on historical data to learn the relationships between the input factors and the suitable crops.
        The Crop Recommendation System offers a valuable tool for farmers to optimize crop selection and improve agricultural 
        productivity. By considering multiple factors affecting crop growth, the system empowers farmers to make informed decisions,
         ultimately leading to enhanced yields and sustainable farming practices. Continued refinement and expansion of the system 
         can further enhance its accuracy and utility in diverse agricultural contexts.

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here I have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
        account. So to see the visualizations interactive I am attaching my <a href="../static/rain.pbix" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">PowerBI</a>
        dashboard file. This requires PowerBI software to open the file. The usage of dashboards like
        these is to bring a better understanding about the dataset and also to bring some beautiful insights</p>
